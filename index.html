    RESPONSIVE CSS VARIABLES:
        using media querries, at a specific screen width,
        we can make the values of some css variables to change.
        
        in this project, we made the values of the css variables concerning fonts
        "--normal-font-size", "--bigger-font-size", "smaller-font-size"
        to change when the screen width exceeds 1024px



    BOXICONS:
        Boxicons is a popular icon library 
        that provides a collection of vector icons 
        that can be used in web development projects. 
        These icons are designed to be lightweight, customizable, and easy to use

    
    HSL:
        The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, 
        is another way to represent colors. 
        
        The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: 
        a number from 0 to 360 for hue, 
        a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and 
        a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness. 
        
        If you imagine a color wheel, 
        the hue red is at 0 degrees, 
        green is at 120 degrees, and 
        blue is at 240 degrees. 
        (check color wheel on wikipedia)
        
        Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color. 
        Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.

        A lightness of 50% represents the original color, while values below 50% darken the color, and values above 50% lighten the color.
        
        hsl(0, 100%, 50%) represents pure red
        hsl(240, 100%, 50%) represents pure blue


    Image Responsiveness (max-width:100%):
        setting max-width to 100% inidicate that the image should not exceed the width of its container element.

        this ensure that the images are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

        additionally, you can make the height property set to auto so that the aspect ratio of the image is preserved


    Responsiveness (width vs max-width property):
        width: 1024px
            element will have a fixed width of exactly 1024 pixels,
            regardless of the size of its container or the viewport..

            if the element's container or viewport is narrower than 1024 pixels, 
            the element may overflow and its content might not be fully visible.

        max-width: 1024px
            element's width will be responsive not static
            and will not exceed 1024 pixels.

            if the element's container or viewport is narrower than 1024 pixels, 
            the element will automatically scale down 
            and adjust its width to fit within the available space.

            if the container or viewport is wider than 1024 pixels, 
            the element will not expand beyond 1024 pixels 
            and will instead take up the available width.


    The row-gap property:
        a flex property that sets the spacing between each row in the flexbox works similar to space-between.


    Web Effect Concept: Style Shift - transitioning an element styles
        Style Shifting is a web effect concept that involves 
        the gradual transformation of an element's appearance, 
        resulting in an engaging and visually appealing transition. 
        
        This effect is commonly observed when reloading a page or interacting with elements like buttons.

        The concept revolves around the transition of an element 
        from its initial state to a final state,
        where it undergoes various style modifications. 
        Let's consider an example where the element in focus is a button:

        1.) Initial State: The button starts in a simple state, 
        usually as plain text enclosed within an anchor tag. 
        It lacks any distinctive visual characteristics.

        2.) Final State: To achieve the desired effect, the button is styled to its final state. 
        This involves applying changes such as adding padding, margin, background color, and text color. 
        These alterations transform the button into a visually appealing and interactive element.

        3.) Transition Property: To enable the shifting effect, a CSS transition is applied to the button. 
        The transition property is set, specifying the desired transition duration, such as 0.4 seconds. 
        This duration determines the speed at which the transformation from the initial state to the final state occurs.

        4.) Transition Effect: When the transition property is added, 
        the button undergoes a smooth and gradual transition from its initial state to the final state. 
        The specified style changes, such as padding, margin, background color, and text color, 
        are applied gradually over the transition duration, resulting in a visually pleasing effect.


    the zoom property:
        for bigger screen sizes (2k & 4k) 
        we need the contents of the to scale up
        so that they are clear, therefore we used the zoom property, 
        so that at these screen sizes the page will appear as if it was zoom in 

    
    Using the Scroll Reveal Javascript library
        using the ScrollReveal library to add animation effects 
        when elements come into view during scrolling.

        the ScrollReveal object is created with specified settings like distance and duration. 
        It sets up the overall configuration for the scroll animations.

        distance: "90px": 
        specifies the distance that an element needs to travel 
        to fully enter the viewport before the animation is triggered.

        duration: 3000: 
        sets the duration (in milliseconds) for the animation to complete.

<!-- ===============  WORKFLOW  =============== -->
<!--
    1.) Fonts-Sizes & Colors CSS Variables
        Drafting Out CSS varibles for the colors & fonts to be used for the project. utilizing the rem unit when setting fonts and the hsl color method when sorting colors.

        Also making the variables responsive,
        by using media querries to change their values for big screen.


    2.) Font Family CSS Variables
        Choose a Font Family from Google fonts.
        choosing the space grotesk with styles 
        "regular 400", "medium 500" and "bold 700". 
        using "@import rule" to embed the font.


    3.) Configuring some base syles
        this involves
            - setting "all elements" to have "border-box" box sizing
            - removing all margin & paddin in "all elements"
            - setting the font-family, font-size, font-weight, text-color of the "body element"
            - setting all "image element" via the "max-width property to 100% to ensure responsiveness. 
            by default the img element width is set to the actual width of the image, 
            which could cause overflow and horizontal scrolling if the image is large. 
            We want to avoid this issue.
            - removing the list-style & text-decoration of the "ul & a element"


    4.) Configuring the Header and Nav for Mobile
        this involves
            - placing the all the nav items in the header (nav-logo, nav-menu, nav-toggle)
            - configuring the nav-menu styles
            - configuring the visiblility of the nav-menu by click of the nav-toggle.
            this is configured by changing the position of the nav-menu,
            this is done via a class show-menu


    5.) Configuring the main part of the page for Mobile
        this involves 
            - position the "404 text" and "404 ghost" via grid layout
            - animating the "404 ghost" and its shadow via keyframes

    
    6.) Configuring for Medium Screen Sizes (>727px)
        this involves 
            - ensuring the navigation shows by default horizontally
            - the navigation toggle and navigation close element are hidden

    
    7.) Configuring for large Screen Sizes (>1024px)
        this involves
            - the "404 text" and "404 ghost" lay horizontally
            - the size of the "404 ghost" increases

    
    8.) Configuring for 2k & 4k Screen Sizes (>2048px & >3840)
        this involves utilizing the zoom property to make sure
        the content of the page are clear.

    
    9.) Animating the reveal of some of the elements using ScrollReveal.js
        the "404 text" element, the "404 ghost" element, the footer


    
    ✅ Add Project Info UI
